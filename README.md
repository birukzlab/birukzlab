### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Biruk, and I am a data scientist and analyst interested in learning more about database engineering, data science and machine learning!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several data analysis and machine learning projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning neural network like CNN, RNN, LLM etc.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
