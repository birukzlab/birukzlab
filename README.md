### Hi there 👋

My name is Biruk, and I am an AI Engineer focused on building AI agents and practical machine learning solutions.

* 🔭 Currently building ML + data products and shipping small AI apps end-to-end
* 🌱 Learning deep learning and modern LLM stacks (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers/LLMs, RAG, agents)
* 👯 Open to collaborating on agentic workflows, ML pipelines, and applied NLP projects
*💬 Ask me about Python, SQL, ML, dashboards (Power BI), and turning ideas into MVPs

Always learning, always building
